        <div class="bodya">BMW was founded in 1916 as an aircraft engine manufacturer. After World War I, the company shifted to producing motorcycles and cars. In the 1960s and 1970s, 
            BMW became known for its high-performance sports sedans, and in the 1980s and 1990s, it expanded its product line to include luxury vehicles. 
            Today, BMW produces a wide range of luxury vehicles and motorcycles, and has invested in electric and hybrid technology. 
            It is headquartered in Munich, Germany and is one of the top three luxury automakers in Germany.</div>
